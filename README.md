# Intro to AI
We are going to create a little experiment utilizing the OpenAI API for Node.js. For this project, we will create an Ad Generator as seen on [Moon Highway](https://www.moonhighway.com/)

We will:
* Set up a simple react app for the frontend / user interaction
* Configure OpenAI and integrate the API
* Create a text prompt based model

## To Get Started
