# Intro to AI
We are going to create a little experiment utilizing the OpenAI API for Node.js. For this project, we will create an Ad Generator as seen on [Moon Highway](https://www.moonhighway.com/)

We will:
* Set up a simple react app for the frontend / user interaction
* Configure OpenAI and integrate the API
* Create a text prompt based model

## To Get Started
`git clone https://github.com/KiraCorbett/intro-to-ai.git`

Then run `npm install`

Enter your OepnAPI keys in `AdComponent.js` to test. There are two spots with comments to fill in.

To start the app, `npm start`
